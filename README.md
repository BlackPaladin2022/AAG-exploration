Exploration into After Armageddon Gaiden (SegaCD/MegaCD)

This is just a place where I can jot down whatever information I can glean on when it comes to the SegaCD game, After Armageddon Gaiden: Maju Toushouden Eclipse.  I cannot guarantee that a translation patch is possible, but I can do the best I can with what I can do currently.

aag-filenotes-textlocations.txt 

This document shows the names and numbers of files located inside the first file of the game's CD structure, generated by CDMage.  Not sure if this is the proper terminology.  Also, below the list is the locations of text in the game's files.  Files that have the "No apparent text blocks" message below them doesn't appear to have any areas of text within said file.  Again, just speculation.

Exploration into After Armageddon Gaiden (SegaCD/MegaCD)

This is just a place where I can jot down whatever information I can glean on when it comes to the SegaCD game, After Armageddon Gaiden: Maju Toushouden Eclipse.  I cannot guarantee that a translation patch is possible, but I can do the best I can with what I can do currently.

eclipse04.tbl (Table File of After Armageddon Gaiden, containing entries for all hiragana, katakana, kanji, and any dictionary entries used in the game; file uses SHIFT-JIS encoding)
eclipse04a.tbl (this file is identical to the file "eclipse04.tbl" except that it uses UTF-8 encoding)
